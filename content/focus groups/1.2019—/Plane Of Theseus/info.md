title: Plane of Theseus
description: exploring virtualisation and financialisation
---

_PLANE OF THESEUS_ is a focus group considering the crisis Boeing is currently undergoing, caused by the grounding of their new 737 MAX plane, as a starting point to discuss system thinking, software virtualisation and financialisation. 

The focus group asks when and how a plane ceases to be a plane, analysing it as a system able to impact its actions through virtualisation, and as the result of a system able to impact its value through financialisation. Participants explore the topic producing screen based work.
