description: exploring virtualisation and financialisation
---

_PLANE OF THESEUS_ is a focus group taking boeing's 737 max crisis as a starting point to discuss system thinking, software virtualisation and financialisation; the focus group asks when and how a plane ceases to be a plane, analysing it as a system able to impact its actions through virtualisation, and as the result of a system able to impact its value through financialisation; participants explore the topic producing screen-based work; since 2019, PLANE OF THESEUS has been held at Weißensee Kunsthochschule and Ravensbourne University London
