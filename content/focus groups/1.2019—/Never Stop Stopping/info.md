NEVER STOP STOPPING is a focus group on the figure of the trader and its relationship to financial stock markets; the focus group aims to demystify the myth of the market-driving trader, analysing how it is constructed; framing money as an autonomous device able to create its own survival circuits, the focus groups discusses the financial stock market as one such dominating circuit, repositioning the trader as a passive actuator bowing to the intensities of the market; this sub-DOM relationship is explored through the collective watching and discussing of self-educational trading material; NEVER STOP STOPPING was first held at London College of Communication in 2019
