description: Exploring virtualisation and financialisation
---

_PLANE OF THESEUS_ is a focus group taking Boeing's 737 MAX crisis, culminating in the 2019 grounding of the plane, as a starting point to discuss systems thinking, software virtualisation and financialisation.
<COLBREAK>
The focus group asks when and how a plane ceases to be a plane, unpacking it both as a system able to impact its actions through virtualisation and as the result of a system able to impact its value through financialisation. Participants explore the topic producing&#8196;screen&#8196;based&#8196;work.
