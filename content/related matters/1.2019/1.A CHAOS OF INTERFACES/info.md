description: A public mapping of tax haven infrastructure

A CHAOS OF INTERFACES publicly maps a portion of the network of tax advisors and shell companies found in Porto, Portugal through a series of interconnected tiles.

Each tile represents an interface for the exchange of money: either a local tax advisor, an intermediary, a shell company or an address otherwise affiliated with a financial entity.

The mapping uses data from the ICIJ Offshore Leaks <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/" target="_blank">database</a> and information gathered during an artist residency in Porto. It was installed outside the city's busiest metro station, Trindade.
