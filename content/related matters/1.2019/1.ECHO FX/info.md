230616 2200: as polls close in the UK referendum on EU membership, Nigel Farage, a former commodities broker and the global face of Leave EU, immediately concedes defeat.

230616 2252: in a Foreign Exchange market imbued with Remain sentiment, the network effect of Farage's concessions pushes the Pound to its highest point against the Dollar in six months.

240616 0528: the Pound reaches its lowest point in 30 years, losing 12% of its value against the dollar.

_ECHO FX_ replays the night of the 2016 UK EU membership referendum vote through the echoes of disinformation spread on social media. Suggesting a Remain win, those echoes manipulated market sentiment in order to inflate the value of the Pound, seemingly setting it up for a "pump and dump", a form of trading fraud aimed at boosting the value of an asset through misleading statements.

As the Pound subsequently collapsed amongst market disbelief, a number of London City traders with access to insider information pointing to a Leave win made millions from the Pound's collapse.

ECHO FX was screened on the third birthday of the Referndum night, in June 2019, and performed live 24h before the UK left the EU, in January 2020.
