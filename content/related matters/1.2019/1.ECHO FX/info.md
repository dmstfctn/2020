ECHO FX replays the night of the 2016 United Kingdom E<span class="dc-hide-on-large">uropean </span>U<span class="dc-hide-on-large">nion</span> membership referendum through the echoes of disinformation spread on social media by Nigel Farage, in an apparent effort to short the pound.</span>

Suggesting a Remain win, those echoes manipulated market sentiment and contributed to inflate the value of the pound before, amongst market disbelief, the result of the referendum became apparent. As the pound crashed, a number of London City traders with access to pollster information pointing to a Leave win made millions shorting it.
