_A CHAOS OF INTERFACES_ is a partial mapping of the global network through which money seeks security. The installation shows interfaces enabling money's accumulation and exchange found in, linked to, or passing through Porto.

An interface is a local tax advisor, a shell company, an intermediary, or an address otherwise affiliated with a financial entity. These are presented as groups of tiles, with adjacent tiles tracing the connections through which money moves or shields itself. 

A CHAOS OF INTERFACES uses connection data from the ICIJ's Offshore Leaks database and local information gathered during a Porto residency by DEMYSTIFICATION COMMITTEE. It was installed outside Porto's busiest metro station, Trindade.
