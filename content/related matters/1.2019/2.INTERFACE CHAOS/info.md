_INTERFACE CHAOS_ is the debut short film of the DEMYSTIFICATION COMMITTEE. It explores the search for survival of two entities coexisting in the archipelago of the Seychelles: money and a unique species&#8196;of&#8196;palm&#8196;tree.

In INTERFACE CHAOS, money and palm trees are each observed facing uncertainties in a world largely<COLBREAK> free of human activity, yet populated by signs of different kinds. One such sign is the fruit which the palm trees strive to grow. Another is the empty shell of&#8196;a&#8196;tax&#8196;advisor's&#8196;office.

The short film follows the palm trees in their effort to mark the world with their unique fruit, and follows money&#8196;in&#8196;its&#8196;effort&#8196;to&#8196;guard&#8196;itself.
