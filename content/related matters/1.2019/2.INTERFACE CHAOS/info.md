_INTERFACE CHAOS_ is the debut short film of the DEMYSTIFICATION COMMITTEE. It explores the search for survival of two entities coexisting in the archipelago of the Seychelles: money and a unique species of palm tree.

In INTERFACE CHAOS, money and palm trees are each observed facing uncertainties in a world largely free of human activity, yet populated by signs of different kinds. One such sign is the fruit which the palm trees strive to grow. Another is the empty shell of a tax advisor's office.

The short film follows the palm trees in their effort to mark the world with their unique fruit, and it follows money in its effort to guard itself.

INTERFACE CHAOS features an original soundtrack by SKY H1. Excerpts from the film and information on upcoming screening are available on <a href="http://interfacechaos.com/" target="_blank">INTERFACECHAOS.COM</a><span class="dc-hide-on-large">.</span>
