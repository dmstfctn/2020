_INTERFACE CHAOS_ (2019) explores the search for survival of two entities coexisting in the Seychelles archipelago: money and a unique species of palm tree.

In INTERFACE CHAOS, money and palm trees are each observed facing uncertainties in a world largely free of human activity, yet populated by signs of all kinds. One, the fruit which the palm trees strive to grow. Another, the empty shell of a tax advisor’s office.

INTERFACE CHAOS is the debut short film of the DEMYSTIFICATION COMMITTEE and features an original soundtrack by SKY H1. Excerpts from it, alongside further information on upcoming screening are available on [INTERFACECHAOS.COM](http://interfacechaos.com/)
