_NETWORK STUDY I, VII, VIII_ is a set of three audiovisual pieces exploring urban network infrastructure. Each piece reproduces the activity of wireless networks by translating captured data into sound, textual information, pictograms and warping satellite&#8196;imagery.

NETWORK STUDY I explores the London Internet Exchange (LINX) area of the London Docklands, inhabited by buildings with imposing grey exteriors, surrounded by metal fencing and security cameras,<COLBREAK>where 600 operators connect to exchange traffic.<span class="dc-hide-on-small-landscape"> In its proximity is Canary Wharf, a key European financial hub, thriving on the network performance and&#8196;scalability&#8196;offered&#8196;by&#8196;LINX&#8196;services.</span>

NETWORK STUDY VII explores an area of Vatican City housing the Governorate's Department of Telecommunication and the Vatican Radio; having supported Marconi research into radio transmissions in the 1930s, the Vatican was an early adopter of a stable shortwave transmission system. <span class="dc-hide-on-small-landscape">Ever since,<COLBREAK>the Vatican maintains a rich infrastructure of networks for the telecommunications and radio propaganda.</span>

NETWORK STUDY VIII focuses on the US Embassy in Rome, housed in close proximity to the administrative buildings of the Italian government.<span class="dc-hide-on-small-landscape"> As seen on NSA documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the embassy's roof allegedly features a surveillance system to target nearby communications via equipment hid behind "false architectural features."</span>
