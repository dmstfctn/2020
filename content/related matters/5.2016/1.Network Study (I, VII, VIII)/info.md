description: surveying urban wireless network infrastructure

_NETWORK STUDY I, VII, VIII_ is a set of three audiovisual pieces exploring network infrastructure; each piece reproduces the activity of wireless networks by translating captured data into sound, textual information, pictograms and warping satellite imagery.

NETWORK STUDY I explores the London Internet Exchange (LINX), an area inhabited by buildings with imposing grey exteriors, surrounded by metal fencing and security cameras, where 600 operators connect to exchange traffic; in its proximity is Canary Wharf, a key European financial hub, thriving on the network performance and scalability offered by LINX services.

NETWORK STUDY VII explores an area of Vatican City housing the Governorate's Department of Telecommunication and the Vatican Radio; having supported Marconi research into radio transmissions in the 1930s, the Vatican was an early adopter of a stable shortwave transmission system; ever since the Vatican maintains a rich infrastructure of networks for the telecommunications and radio propaganda.

NETWORK STUDY VIII focuses on the US Embassy in Rome, housed in close proximity to many administrative buildings of the Italian government; as seen on NSA documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the roof of the US Embassy allegedly featured a surveillance system to target nearby communications through equipment "hid behind false architectural features”.
