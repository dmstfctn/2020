NETWORK STUDIES explore urban network infrastructure, each reproducing the activity of the wireless networks found around financial hubs, transport hubs and data hubs; data captured from those networks is translated into sonic signals and visualised as either lists, symbols, aggregates or warping satellite imagery, responding to the typology and intensity of the network activity; locations explored include: network study i, docklands and canary wharf; network study v, fiumicino airport; network study vii, vatican city; network study viii, u.s. embassy in rome; network study xi, stansted airport
