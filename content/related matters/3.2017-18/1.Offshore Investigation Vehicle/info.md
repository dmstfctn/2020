---

The _OFFSHORE INVESTIGATION VEHICLE_ was an international corporate structure set up to model offshore corporate financial practices and grasp their inner workings by engaging directly with tax havens.

The vehicle consisted of Empire Management Limited, a UK private limited company directed by members&#8196;of&#8196;the&#8196;DEMYSTIFICATION&#8199;COMMITTEE; <COLBREAK>Invest. One Limited, a Seychelles International Business Company directed by a nominee; and a corporate bank account, held by Invest. One Limited with&#8196;Euro&#8196;Pacific&#8196;Bank,&#8196;in&#8196;Puerto&#8196;Rico.

The OFFSHORE INVESTIGATION VEHICLE was joined by 58 members of the public through the issue of Empire Management Limited shares, allowing them <COLBREAK>to explore its structure and operational scope through a&#8196;series&#8196;of&#8196;lecture&#8196;performances&#8196;and&#8196;exhibitions.
