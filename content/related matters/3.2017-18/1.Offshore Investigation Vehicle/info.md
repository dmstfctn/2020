The _OFFSHORE INVESTIGATION VEHICLE_ was an international corporate structure set up to model offshore corporate financial practices and grasp their inner workings by engaging directly with tax havens.

The OFFSHORE INVESTIGATION VEHICLE consisted of Empire Management Limited, a UK private limited company directed by members of the DEMYSTIFICATION COMMITTEE; Invest. One Limited, a Seychelles International Business Company directed by a nominee; and a corporate bank account, held by Invest. One Limited with Euro Pacific Bank, in Puerto Rico.

The OFFSHORE INVESTIGATION VEHICLE was joined by 58 members of the public through the issue of Empire Management Limited shares, allowing them to explore its structure and operational scope through a series of lecture-performances and exhibitions.

Those operations are publicly documented on the [UK registrar of companies](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10807527/filing-history), while company formation information is released as a [PDF](https://demystification.co/mmittee/downloads/Offshore_Investigation_Vehicle.pdf).
