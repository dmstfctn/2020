FLASH is a sonic reenactment of one of the fastest stock market crashes in history, occurred on may 6, 2010; as a set of strange and seemingly unconnected events took place globally on that day, commentators searched for a meaningful narrative; speculations continued until 2015, when a london trader was arrested and extradited to the us to be charged with market manipulation; accused of inflating the financial market to profit from its chaos, the trader admitted to the use of software hacked to enable spoofing - a tactic used to alter the perceived supply and demand of a commodity on the stock market in order to affect its value; FLASH was performed on the 8th anniversary of the crash, translating that day's trading data from the new york and chicago stock exchange into sound
