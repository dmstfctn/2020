_FLASH_ is a sonic reenactment of one of the fastest stock market crashes in history, occurred on May 6, 2010 and known as Flash Crash.

As a set of strange events took place globally on that day, from election outcomes to austerity protesting, commentators searched for a meaningful narrative to the stock market accident. Speculations continued until 2015, when a London trader was arrested and extradited to the US, in order to be charged with market manipulation. 

Accused of inflating the financial market to profit from its chaos, the trader admitted to the use of software hacked to enable "spoofing", a tactic used to alter the perceived supply and demand of a commodity on the stock market in order to affect its value.

FLASH was performed on the 8th anniversary of the crash, translating that day's trading data from the new york and chicago stock exchange into sound
