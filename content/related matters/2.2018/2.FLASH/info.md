FLASH is a sonic reenactment of the fastest stock market crash in history, occurred on may 6, 2010; as a set of strange and seemingly unconnected events took place globally on that day, commentators searched for a meaningful narrative; speculations continued until 2015, when a london trader was arrested and extradited to the us to be charged with market manipulation; accused of inflating the financial market to profit from its chaos by utilising a customised piece of home trading software, the trader admitted to the use of software hacked to enable spoofing - a tactic used to alter the perceived supply and demand of a commodity on the stock market in order to affect its value; FLASH was performed on the 8th anniversary of the crash, using custom software to translate new york and chicago stock exchange trading data from may 6, 2010 into sound
