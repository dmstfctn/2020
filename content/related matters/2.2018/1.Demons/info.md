description: reenacting the first algorithmic market crash
---

DEMONS replays the first stock market crash caused by algorithmic trading, occurred on october 19, 1987; responding to a set of strange and seemingly unconnected events unfolding at the time of market opening, the computers of institutional investors on the new york stock exchange executed a choreography of trades in an effort to protect the values of their portfolios against volatile market conditions; a domino effect was triggered as computers followed a herd trading logic, dictated by the analysis of each others’ trading patterns; DEMONS was performed on the 31st anniversary of the crash, using custom-software to translate historic new york stock exchange trading data from the day into sound; the piece explores volatility on 24/7/365 financial markets saturated with the noise of global events and imbued with algorithmic confirmation bias
