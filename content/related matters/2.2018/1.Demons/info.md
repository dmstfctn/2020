_DEMONS_ is an audiovisual performance replaying the first stock market crash to be caused by algorithmic trading, occurred on October 19, 1987 and known as Black Monday. The piece explores confirmation bias in algorithmic trading.

On that day, responding to a set of strange and seemingly unconnected events unfolding at the time of market opening, the computers of institutional investors on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) executed a number of quick trades in order to protect the values of their portfolios against volatile market conditions.

As algorithms followed a herd trading logic dictated by the technical analysis of each others' trading patterns, a domino effect was triggered. Large sums of money were lost as the communications systems of the NYSE were overwhelemed by the amount of trading orders submitted by the algorithms, "demons of our own design".

DEMONS was performed on the 31st anniversary of Black Monday, using custom software to translate NYSE trading data from October 19, 1987 into sound.
