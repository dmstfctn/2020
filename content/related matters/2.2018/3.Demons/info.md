_DEMONS_ is an audiovisual performance exploring confirmation bias in algorithmic trading. It replays the first stock market crash to be caused by algorithms, occurred on October 19, 1987 and known as Black Monday.

On that day, responding to a set of strange and seemingly unconnected events unfolding at the time of market opening, the computers of institutional<COLBREAK>investors on the New York Stock Exchange automatically executed a number of trades in order to protect the values of their portfolios against volatile market&#8196;conditions.

As algorithms followed a herd trading logic<span class="dc-hide-on-small-landscape">dictated by the technical analysis of each others' trading patterns</span>, a domino effect was triggered. Large sums of money were lost as the communications systems <COLBREAK>of the New York Stock Exchange became overwhelemed by the amount of<span class="dc-hide-on-small-landscape">trading</span> orders submitted by the algorithms, "demons of our own design" in the words of a Wall Street risk manager.

<span class="dc-hide-on-small-landscape">DEMONS was performed on the 31st anniversary of Black Monday, using custom software to translate New York Stock Exchange trading data from October 19, 1987 into sound.</span>
