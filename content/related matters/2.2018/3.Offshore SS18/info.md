description: a beachwear collection and tax evasion scheme
---

_OFFSHORE SS18_ is a beachwear collection consisting of three swimsuits, two pairs of swim shorts and a beach-towel; the apparel was produced in an edition of 90 total items and sold through an international corporate structure set up by the DEMYSTIFICATION COMMITTEE to model offshore corporate financial practices; any customer purchasing beachwear from an online store triggered a tax evasion scheme whereby the revenue from the sale would be moved offshore in order to evade corporate tax; the resulting savings were distributed back to members of the public who had originally invested in the collection by purchasing shares of the corporate structure producing it; the tax evasion scheme is documented through diagrams printed on the apparel
