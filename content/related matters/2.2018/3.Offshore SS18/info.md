title: Offshore SS18
description: a beachwear collection and tax evasion scheme
---

_OFFSHORE SS18_ is a beachwear collection consisting of three swimsuits, two pairs of swim shorts and a beach towel. The apparel was produced in an edition of 90 total items and sold through an international corporate structure set up by the DEMYSTIFICATION COMMITTEE to model offshore corporate financial practices.

Any customer purchasing beachwear from an [online store](http://shop.demystification.co/) triggered a tax evasion scheme whereby the revenue from the sale would be moved offshore in order to evade corporate tax. The resulting savings were distributed back to members of the public who had originally invested in the collection by purchasing shares of the corporate structure producing it. 

The tax evasion scheme is documented through diagrams printed on the apparel.
