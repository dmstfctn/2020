description: A noise sound project using network data
---

THE NETWORK ENSEMBLE is a noise project making use of wireless network data as creative medium. The project consists of both machines able to translate data captured from wireless networks into sound and desktop software able to further modulate the sound for live performance.

Executed by two human operators, the performances carried out under the moniker explore the activity of local wireless networks. <span class="dc-hide-on-small">Among other locations, THE NETWORK ENSEMBLE notably performed at the Design Museum in London, Onassis Stegi in Athens and SPEKTRUM in Berlin.</span>

THE NETWORK ENSEMBLE debuted on the Italian label NUKFM in 2016 with 'Selected Network Studies'. In 2019 the German label MILLE PLATEAUX released <a href="https://forceincmilleplateaux.bandcamp.com/album/flash-demons" target="_blank">'Flash Demons.'</a>
