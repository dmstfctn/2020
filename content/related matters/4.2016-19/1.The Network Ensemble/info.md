THE NETWORK ENSEMBLE was a noise project making use of wireless network data as creative medium. It consisted of machines able to translate data captured from local wireless networks into sonic signals; and a piece of custom software able to further modulate these signals into sounds.

Executed by two human operators, the noise performances executed under the moniker explored the activity of local wireless networks through sound.

The NETWORK ENSEMBLE is released by NUKFM and MILLE PLATEAUX.
