NETWORK STUDY I, Ⅶ & Ⅷ are audiovisual pieces exploring urban network infrastructure. Each reproduces wireless network activity captured using custom hardware and software as sound, text, pictograms and warping satellite imagery.

NETWORK STUDY I foucuses on the London Internet Exchange, a land of imposing grey buildings<span class="dc-hide-on-small-landscape">, surrounded by metal fencing and security cameras,</span> where hundreds of network operators meet to exchange traffic. <span class="dc-hide-on-small-landscape"> In its proximity is Canary Wharf, a key European financial hub thriving on the network <COLBREAK>performance and scalability offered by the London Internet&#8196;Exchange.</span>

NETWORK STUDY Ⅶ focuses on an area of the Vatican City housing the Governorate's Department of Telecommunication and the Vatican Radio.<span class="dc-hide-on-small-landscape"> Having supported Marconi's research into radio transmissions in the 1930s, the Vatican was an early adopter of a stable shortwave transmission system. Ever since, the Vatican has maintained a rich telecommunications and&#8196;radio&#8196;infrastructure&#8196;network.</span><COLBREAK>

NETWORK STUDY Ⅷ focuses on the US Embassy in Rome, located in close proximity to administrative buildings of the Italian government.<span class="dc-hide-on-small-landscape"> As seen on NSA documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the embassy's roof housed false architectural features to hide surveillance equipment targeting nearby&#8196;communications.</span>
